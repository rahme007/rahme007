I'm Rafi, a Ph.D. candidate at FIU with a major in electrical engineering. 

I'm very much inquisitive and passionate about statistical and visual information processing. That is why I love to apply image processing techniques and machine learning methods to the field of computer vision. Also, I like to explore data structure algorithms to solve fundamental problems in feature extraction. 

âš¡ Fun fact #1: I like to listen to songs of different genres :musical_note:; R&B, hip-hop, and country songs are my favorites. My favorite singer is Akon :man_singer:. <br>
âš¡ Fun fact #2: I love to travel a lot. So far, my favorite place to travel is the great smoky mountain national park in Tennessee, USA
