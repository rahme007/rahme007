I'm Rafi, a Ph.D. graduate from FIU with a major in electrical and computer engineering. Currently, I am working as a system engineer at Crown Equipment Corporation. If you would like to talk, ping me on LinkedIn.

I'm very much inquisitive and passionate about statistical and sensor signal processing. That is why I love to apply image processing techniques and machine learning methods to the field of sensor(Radar,Lidar) system. Also, I like to explore algorithms to solve fundamental problems in feature extraction. My current work revolves around algorithm development for automotive and airborne radar systems.

âš¡ Fun fact #1: I like to listen to songs of different genres :musical_note:; R&B, hip-hop, and country songs are my favorites. My favorite singer is Akon :man_singer:. <br>
âš¡ Fun fact #2: I love to travel a lot :mountain: :camping: :beach_umbrella:. So far, my favorite place to travel is the great smoky mountain national park :national_park: in Tennessee, USA
